------------------------------------------------------

IMPLEMENTATION:
# Error: Missing 'node modules'
# Solution: run 'npm i' after cloning repo to reinstall dependencies in the project 
# (Above solution only works if package.json exists in current project directory)

# Error: "Building Javascript bundle" on loop. 
# Solution: Due to iCloud drive updating every change made.
# Go to system preferences -> iCloud -> iCloud Drive (Options) -> uncheck Desktops & Documents Folders

# DESIGN:
# Developed/discussed on a navigation system and app flow.
# Object-Oriented: Groups contain events and events contain rides(requests and offers)
# ---Groups-------
# ------Events----
# --------Rides---

# Day 4 (Hackathon Day 2)
# Start coding first login screen and profile creation page
# Continue designing screens/ux

# IMPLEMENTATION:
# Package: npm install --save react-navigation
# Installs a package that manages navigation system.

# Entry starts at App.js
# Create a variable that calls the createStackNavigator. This will package
# 	the routing of the different screens as a React component.
# Create a variable that calls the createAppContainer containing the createStackNavigator variable.
# 	This will package the entire entrypoint of the app with the stackNavigator component.

# Package: npm install --save react-native-elements
# Installs a package that includes ui components.

# Rule: Create components on a separate file if it's a component 
# 	that will be used multiple times in a file. 

# Package: npm install --save react-native-snap-carousel
# Installs a package that enables scrolling horizontally like a slideshow in place.
