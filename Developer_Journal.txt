# Day 3 (Hackathon Day 1)
# Setup environment and cloned repo to mac mini.

# HELP:
# IMPLEMENTATION tag are development/coding details
# DESIGN tag are user experience details
# Error sub-tags display error description 
# Solution sub-tags display solutions to previous error tag
# Package sub-tags display package that needs to be installed.

------------------------------------------------------

IMPLEMENTATION:
# Error: Missing 'node modules'
# Solution: run 'npm i' after cloning repo to reinstall dependencies in the project 
# (Above solution only works if package.json exists in current project directory)

# Error: "Building Javascript bundle" on loop. 
# Solution: Due to iCloud drive updating every change made.
# Go to system preferences -> iCloud -> iCloud Drive (Options) -> uncheck Desktops & Documents Folders

# DESIGN:
# Developed/discussed on a navigation system and app flow.
# Object-Oriented: Groups contain events and events contain rides(requests and offers) 
# ---Groups-------
# ------Events----
# --------Rides---
# --------Rides---

# Day 4 (Hackathon Day 2)
# Start coding first login screen and profile creation page
# Continue designing screens/ux

# IMPLEMENTATION:
# Package: npm install --save react-navigation
# Installs a package that manages navigation system.

# Entry starts at App.js
# Create a variable that calls the createStackNavigator. This will package
# 	the routing of the different screens as a React component.
# Create a variable that calls the createAppContainer containing the createStackNavigator variable.
# 	This will package the entire entrypoint of the app with the stackNavigator component.

# Package: npm install --save react-native-elements
# Installs a package that includes ui components.

# Rule: Create components on a separate file if it's a component 
# 	that will be used multiple times in a file. 

# Package: npm install --save react-native-snap-carousel
# Installs a package that enables scrolling horizontally like a slideshow in place.




# Day 5 (2/18/19) 10am-2:45pm
# It's a nice warm sunny day after a series of rainy days. Time to stay locked inside the basement. Caught Gabriel up to speed with project
# Setup Digital Ocean account and create droplet.
# Username: yal318@ucsd.edu
# Password: venn
# Droplet password: venndiagram
# IP: 178.128.177.5

# IMPLEMENTATION:
# Initial Landing page buttons
#   Login
#   Sign-up
#   Forgot Password (Low Priority)
#   FB Login API (Low priority) 

# Create Account Page
#   (Input) Name
#   (Input) Phone Number
#   (Input) Email(Optional)
#   (Button) Submit
# Inside App.js, root stack, you see "CreateAccount: CreateAccountScreen"
# That is where the CreateAccountScreen url is extracted from
# So inside InitialScreen when you click the "Sign-Up" button, it directs you
# to the CreateAccountScreen. Navigation is done via "this.props.navigation.navigate()"

# Having issue with this.props.navigation.navigate(). 
# Fixed. There were errors with the file paths.

# Learned to clean up screens by separating component implementation with
# static display. 
# Learned to navigate to new page with onclick.
# Route and Screen management overall improvement



# Day 6 (2/23/19)
# Took me 7 tries to parallel park.
# Yang, Gabriel, Martin, Kimo
# Daily Goals: Implement the following screens
#   Create Account Screen
#   Welcome/Tutorial Screen?
#   Reset Password Screen
#   Home Screen
# Design 
#   Carousel Information (usage)
#   Welcome Information (specific usage)

# IMPLEMENTATION:
# Initial Screen (Increased fidelity)
#   Removed header
#   Added animation keyboard when input pressed
#   TODO: "Package" TextInput and Touchable component as a "form"
#          that redirects based on if input is registered in database.
#          If phone number exists, redirect to continuing user workflow ((LOGIN)Home)
#          Else, redirect to new user workflow (Create account - > Welcome -> Home)
# Package: npm i react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view --save
# (Might need to uninstall; used animate.view instead to manage this)



# Day 7 (3/2/19)
# Light rain, heavy mood
# Yang, Kimo, Celine, Martin
# Daily Goal: Redesign Wireframe, Continue working on front end ui skeleton code
# Vennpool 2.0: https://xd.adobe.com/spec/04931d36-74d4-411d-6e33-45ab2d591740-72a2/

# IMPLEMENTATION:
# Setted up HomeScreen, started on working on creating an EventCard component.
# Removed backswipe gesture once at the homescreen with gestureEnabled: false and headerLeft: null.

# Task: create the other screens and link properly. Focus on skeleton code so we can start working on facebook implementation.
